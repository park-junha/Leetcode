**Difficulty**: Medium

### Problem

Given *n* non-negative integers *a<sub>1</sub>*, *a<sub>2</sub>*, ..., *a<sub>n</sub>* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *a<sub>i</sub>*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

**Example**:
